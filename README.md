●“Customer Churn” refers to the state in which the customer or the
subscriber stops involving transactional activities with the bank.
● We are trying to determine whether a customer will close his/her account
with the bank based on given features by posing a binary classification
problem using Machine learning
models .
● In the Business aspect this project may be useful to the marketing team
of the bank where the Organization can take respective action to retain
the customer.
● I have tried various Machine learning algorithms along with feature Engineering to get the best accuracy of it.In this project I have used F1-Score as Metric as it uses harmonic mean of Precision and recall.
